# Day 4 Candidate-Risk Alerts

## Scope and terminology

The alert layer screens for candidate operational risks. It does not diagnose equipment faults, because the OPSD release has no verified fault/event labels for this purpose.

## Three alert rules

1. **Peak-load risk**: predicted net load is at or above the validation-period 95th percentile.
2. **Solar-drop risk**: the observed hourly solar change is at or below the validation-period 5th percentile.
3. **Sustained-deviation risk**: the absolute forecast residual exceeds the validation-period 97.5th percentile for at least three consecutive hours with a consistent deviation run.

Every test alert retains the trigger value, threshold, risk type, and evidence string. Thresholds are calibrated only on the frozen validation period (`2019-01-12 20:00 UTC` through `2019-08-09 20:00 UTC`) and then applied unchanged to the test period.

The alert export also carries the validation-calibrated prediction upper bound, an interval-based peak watch flag, a transparent risk score, and a review priority. The interval watch does not silently convert into a confirmed event: it is an additional human-review signal when the point prediction is below the peak threshold but the empirical upper bound reaches it.

## Calibrated thresholds

- Peak predicted net load: `55,406.34 MW`
- Solar hourly drop: `-4,243.00 MW/h`
- Absolute residual: `2,936.54 MW`
- Sustained duration: `3 hours`

The test period contains 1,023 rows with at least one candidate-risk flag. This is a screening count, not a fault count or accuracy claim.

## Synthetic stress test

Because real labels are unavailable, the implementation injects 25 deterministic three-hour stress events per category into a copy of the test frame. The seed is `20260929`; injected magnitudes are recorded in `outputs/alerts/alert_evaluation.json`.

| Injected category | Point detections | Injected points | Detection rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Peak load | 75 | 75 | 100% |
| Solar drop | 25 | 25 | 100% |
| Sustained deviation | 75 | 75 | 100% |

These rates only verify that the rule mechanics respond to the chosen artificial scenarios. They are not historical detection performance and must not be presented as real fault-detection accuracy.

## Outputs

- Implementation: `src/alerts.py`
- Runner: `scripts/run_alerts.py`
- Frozen thresholds and stress results: `outputs/alerts/alert_evaluation.json`
- Auditable test alert rows: `outputs/alerts/test_candidate_risks.csv`
- Human-review queue, including interval-only peak watches: `outputs/alerts/test_review_queue.csv`

## Known limitations

The rules are percentile-based and region-specific. The solar-drop rule uses actual solar observations, which are suitable for retrospective evaluation but not automatically available at a real forecast issuance time. A production version needs an explicit information-availability design, weather/renewable forecasts, alert deduplication, and expert review.
